# Example Mosaicker Config

# This config file is used to specify the settings for using the pipeline to generate a mosaic from referenced images.

# Indicate what stage of the pipeline to run
pipeline:
  stage: mosaicker

# I/O settings
# These settings assume that the user has mounted their data directory at /data
io_manager:
  # Specifies the input data
  input_dir: /data/input

    # Images with georeferencing. We perform a search for matching files.
    referenced_images:
      # This filepath is relative to input_dir
      directory: referenced_images/220513-FH135
      # This is a RegEx pattern. The "1" selects nadir images only.

# These are settings for the mosaicker itself, which loops through all the images
# and makes the mosaic.
mosaicker:
  # By leaving pixel_width blank, the pixel width is set based on the pixel width
  # of the referenced images.
  pixel_width:
  # By leaving pixel_height blank, the pixel height is set based on the pixel height
  # of the referenced images.
  pixel_height:
  dtype: uint8 # The data type of the output image. uint8 is standard.
  n_bands: 4 # RGB +Alpha = 4 ba

# The image operator is used to blend each pair of images.
image_operator:
  # You can place a border around the image to help see how blending worked.
  # This value is the width of the border.
