# NITELite-pipeline
Code to process images and data taken with the HAB NITELite instrument.

## Analysis Preparations

There are three things you need to do prior to running the pipeline.
1. **Locate your data.** [Limited-access data from a NITELite flight is available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RVNJydEQZ29ElqbNvxbMS5cBAw2bMShU?usp=drive_link), and it is recommended to use it as example data.
2. **Clone this repository.** (`git clone git@github.com:AdlerFarHorizons/NITELite-pipeline.git`)
3. **Create a docker account and download docker desktop.** [Link here.](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
